# Aid4RuralHealth
Welcome to our Rural Healthcare Initiative! Our mission is to improve access to affordable healthcare services and life-saving medical equipment in rural areas of Tanzania. We believe that everyone deserves access to quality healthcare, regardless of where they live.

Our web app allows donors to easily contribute cash, medical equipment, or medicine to support our initiative. We also offer opportunities for doctors to volunteer their services in rural areas where there is a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals.

Our team is passionate about making a positive impact in rural communities, and we're committed to transparency and accountability in all of our efforts. Thank you for your support in helping us achieve our mission.
